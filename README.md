## Study Design

- **Objective**: This study compares a single source survey estimators with capture-recapture (CRC) estimators, the Lincoln-Petersen estimator with the model-based Huggins
estimators (both CRC estimators), and a logistic regression approach with a XGBoost-algorithm modeling approach within the Huggins estimator, with respect to bias and precision, under 
varying levels of measurement error.
- **Design**: Simulating a synthetic population of 10.000 units over 91 days. First capture occassion represent a survey of 2000 units over a period of one time. The second capture
occassion represents sensor data of each unit in the population (census). There are 48 combinations of survey underreporting (false-negatives), sensor underdetection (false-negatives), 
and sensor overdetection (false-positives), which are assessed across 100 iterations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Relative bias (RB); coefficient of variation (CV); relative root mean squared error (RRMSE).

## Data Information

- **Data generation is entirely synthetic**.
- Simulated population includes 10 covariates; only 3 affect capture probabilities.
- Survey and sensor capture events include simulated misreporting (false negatives/positives).
- No personal or identifiable information is included.
- Data are generated on-the-fly via scripts; no raw data files are stored.

## Reproducibility Instructions (Execution Order)

### 1. **Simulate the Population**
source("data/03_simulation_functions.R")  
source("data/01_generate_population.R")  

### 2. **Simulate the first simulation scenario**
First, I simulated the baseline scenario (i.e. no measurement error included). The first iteration will be used for hyperparameter optimization.  
source("code/01_Simulation/02_generate_sample_scenarios.R")  

### 3. **Hyperparameter optimization**
source("code/02_Analysis/02_analysis_functions.R")  
source("code/02_Analysis/01_hyperparameter_selection.R")   # XGBoost tuning  

### 4. **Analysis**
source("02_Analysis/03_analysis.R")  

### 5. **Finish simulation**
Repeat steps 2 and 4 for each of the 48 simulation scenarios  

### 6. **Visualize results**
source("02_Analysis/04_visualization.R")  

### 7. **Inspect output**
Results (plots and summary statistics) will be written to the output/ folder.
